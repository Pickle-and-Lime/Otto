From List View:
Get shoppingList using GET request to /list
Create shoppingListObj using shoppingList
Render shoppingListObj with checkboxes using Angular ng-repeat
Checkboxes flip state of boolean in shoppingListObj
Get master list of items using GET request to /pantry/general 
 (might want to find a different way to do this in future iteration)
Use master list to filter in input text search
When Add button is clicked, do POST to /list to manually add item to list
- On successful rendering, we need to GET the new shopping list from server
- On successful GET, we need to re-create the shoppingListObj
(Maybe add in swipe function on list items to bring up a delete option?)
When Checkout button is clicked, controller should go through shoppingListObj and push 
checked items into array in {items: []} data object
- Then POST this data object to /buy
- Possibly need to GET the new shoppingList, then re-create the shoppingListObj

From Pantry View: 

buyRouter:
POST to /buy to checkout from Shopping List
Data is {items: [array of item strings...], household: "string of household name"}

householdRouter:
GET to /household to...
POST to /household to...
DELETE to /household to ...

listRouter:
GET to /list to return the shopping list for this particular household
- Need to send {household: "household name"} as part of request
POST to /list to manually add an item to the shopping list
- Data is {item: "item name", household: "household name"}
DELETE to /list to manually delete an item from the shopping list
- Data is {item: "item name", household: "household name"}

pantryRouter:
